        <p align="justify">Welcome to the Instrument Comparator and Scale Displayer help and instructions. Here, you'll learn the features of the <a href="dviice.html">DVIICE</a>, along with some tips.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Mouse over</strong> a note to see all enharmonic (equivalent) notes. Mousing over middle C on the piano, for example, will highlight every middle C in all displayed instruments. It will not, however, highlight all C notes on every octave. Click a note to play it.</p>
        <p align="justify">You can also <strong>display Scales and chord arpeggios</strong> in any key by choosing a scale or chord and a key and clicking <strong>Display Scale</strong>.  All notes in the scale will be highlighted in every octave available on each instrument, with the root notes highlighted in red.<br/>On instruments such as the guitar and diatonic harmonicas where the same note appears in multiple places, the note will be highlighted in every place where it exists (for example -2 and 3 on the diatonic harmonicas), it is up to the player to decide which note position makes the most sense in the scale flow more fluidly.  If you need help distinguishing the individual scale degree notes, you can click <strong>Show Scale Degrees</strong> to display the scale degree over each note (in the Nashville Number System).  In either scale display mode, the root note is always colored in red. To clear the scale click <strong>Clear Scale</strong> and the scale will clear.</p>
        <p align="justify">Clicking <strong>Show Note Names</strong> will show the note names for the currently selected tuning of the instruments that support more than one tuning.</p>
      </div>
        <div align="center">
          <p align="justify">To <strong>select a new instrument</strong>, select the desired instrument and its tuning from the menus above that instrument bank. Click the "Go!" button. Instruments 1 and 2 are limited to the piano, diatonic 10-hole harmonicas, 12-hole chromatic harmonicas, and the ukulele. Instrument 3 can handle any instrument (guitar, piano, ukulele, and harmonicas with 10, 12, or 16 holes).</p>

        <p align="justify">The <strong>diatonic harmonicas</strong> use a plain number for a blow, a "-" for a draw, "'" for each half-step of a bend, "ob" for overblows and "od" for overdraws. For example, the standard C diatonic produces a middle C on the button labeled "1": on an actual harmonica, this would simply mean blowing into hole 1. "6+" would be an overblow on hole 6, "-7od" would be an overdraw on hole 7, "-3''" would be a draw bend (one whole step) on hole 3, and so on.</p>        
        <p align="justify">The <strong>chromatic harmonica</strong> is labeled similarly to the diatonic, with the omission of bends, overblows, and overdraws, and the addition of the slide, denoted by a "&lt;". "1" is a simple blow on hole 1, "-5" is a draw on hole 5, "&lt;3" is a blow on hole 3 with the slide pushed in, and "&lt;-9" is a draw on hole 9 with the slide pushed in.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Piano notes</strong> are laid out with an octave per row. Buttons with a black background correspond to a piano's black keys (sharps/flats), and buttons with a white background correspond to a piano's white keys (whole notes). The labels (C3, F5, and so on) correspond to the actual names of each note: the button labeled "C4 (Mid)" is C4, the middle C.</p>
      <p align="justify">The <strong>guitar buttons</strong> with a silver foreground and white background correspond to guitar frets labeled with a dot. The buttons with a silver foreground and silver background correspond to the frets labeled with a pair of dots (these are the frets located one octave above the open string note). Each button is labeled with the name of the string (row) and the fret number, with "0" meaning an open string. Thus, a guitar tab with a "5" on a row labeled "B" means the fifth fret of the B string, or "B5" on the guitar.</p>
      <p align="justify">The <strong>ukulele buttons</strong> with a silver foreground and white background correspond to guitar frets labeled with a dot. Each button is labeled with the name of the string (row) and the fret number, with "0" meaning an open string. Thus, a ukulele tab with a "5" on a row labeled "B" means the fifth fret of the B string, or "B5" on the ukulele.</p></td>

        <p align="justify">This instrument comparison tool is laid out and organized with CSS styles and tables. Notes are highlighted with Javascript, supplemented by jQuery. It is a completely client-side tool which means you can download it from the source and run it offline on your local machine. <br/>This version of DVIICE can be downloaded and run locally from <a href="https://github.com/odiernod/domdviice">its github location</a></p>
